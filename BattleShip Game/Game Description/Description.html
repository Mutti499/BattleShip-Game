					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						In this project, my goal was to implement the game of Ultimate Battleships. The game is for two people and consists of two phases. <br>
                        First phase is placement phase where players place their 5 available ships on the board. The second phase is battle phase where players try to sink each other's ships. The player with the last ship standing wins. <br>
                        I provided many functions, to be used in specific cases during the game. Below, I explained where each should be used. <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firstly, the rules are printed once at the beginning of the game by the <code>print_rules()</code> function. Check the rules for some details about the game.</li>
                            <li>There is a function named <code>print_3d_list()</code> which expects a 3d list formed of two 2d lists which are supposed to be the player boards and prints them in the expected format.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_ships_to_be_placed()</code> prints the remaining ships to be placed for the player who is taking their turn at that time. It is to be printed immediately after the board during the placement phase.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_single_element()</code> is used to print a single element followed by a single whitespace, and the cursor stays on the same line afterwards. Great for printing elements of a list, such as the names of remaining ships to be placed.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_empty_line()</code> is needed when you need to move the cursor to a new line.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_player_turn_to_place()</code> is used after the remaining ships to be placed are printed. It shows whose turn it is to place those ships.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_to_place_ships()</code> is used immediately after whose turn to place ships is now is announced. It asks for the information to place a ship.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_incorrect_input_format()</code> is to be used during both phases when the user provides bad input. For example, the coordinates might be floats when they should have been integers, or there may not be enough arguments provided.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_incorrect_coordinates()</code> is to be used during both phases when the user provides coordinates outside the board.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_incorrect_ship_name()</code> is to be used during the placement phase when the ship name provided is not a valid one.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_incorrect_orientation()</code> is to be used during the placement phase when the orientation provided is not a valid one.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_ship_is_already_placed()</code> is to be used during the placement phase when the ship name the player chose to place is already placed.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_ship_cannot_be_placed_outside()</code> is to be used during the placement phase when the coordinates and orientation the player chose for a ship exceeds the bounds of the board.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_ship_cannot_be_placed_occupied()</code> is to be used during the placement phase when the coordinates and orientation the player chose for a ship coincides with an already placed ship by them.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_confirm_placement()</code> is to be used at the end of the placement phase when a player has finished placing their ships. I ask if they are sure of their placement. If so, I either move on to the next player or I begin the battle phase. If they want to change their placement, I reset all their ships and start placement again for that player.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_player_turn_to_strike()</code> is to be used during the battle phase, immediately after printing the board to show which player's turn it is.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_choose_target_coordinates()</code> is to be used during the battle phase, after whose turn to strike is announced. It asks the player to choose coordinates to strike on the board.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_miss()</code> is used during the battle phase, after a player takes their turn to strike a coordinate on the enemy board. This is used when the strike fails to hit any enemy ships.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_hit()</code> is used during the battle phase, after a player takes their turn to strike a coordinate on the enemy board. This is used when the strike successfully hits an enemy ship.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_type_done_to_yield()</code> is used during the battle phase, after a player takes their turn to strike and they miss. This is to prevent players accidentally seeing each other's boards.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_tile_already_struck()</code> is used during the battle phase, after a player takes their turn to strike a tile. This is used when the player accidentally chooses an already attacked tile.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_player_won()</code> is used at the end of the battle phase, when a player successfully sinks the other's ships.</li>
                            <li>The function <code>print_thanks_for_playing()</code> is used at the end of the game, after the winner is announced.</li>
